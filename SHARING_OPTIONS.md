# Sharing Options for Multimodal RAG System

Since we've had some challenges with directly pushing to GitHub, here are multiple options for sharing this project:

## Option 1: Manual GitHub Repository Setup

Follow the detailed steps in `MANUAL_GITHUB_SETUP.md` to:
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Connect your local repository to GitHub
3. Push all the code to GitHub

This is the recommended approach for maintaining version control and sharing code professionally.

## Option 2: Use the Archive Files

Two archive files have been created in the parent directory:

1. **TAR Archive**: `../multimodal-rag-system.tar.gz` (76KB)
2. **ZIP Archive**: `../multimodal-rag-system.zip` (28KB)

You can:
- Upload these files directly to GitHub as a release
- Share them via email, Dropbox, Google Drive, or any file sharing service
- Extract them on another machine to get the complete project

Commands to extract the archives:

```bash
# Extract TAR archive
tar -xzvf multimodal-rag-system.tar.gz

# Extract ZIP archive
unzip multimodal-rag-system.zip -d multimodal-rag-system
```

## Option 3: GitHub Web Interface Upload

If you're having issues with Git commands:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Click "uploading an existing file" link on the empty repository page
3. Drag and drop files from your local project
4. Commit the changes directly on GitHub

Note: This method can be tedious for many files and doesn't preserve Git history.

## Option 4: GitHub Desktop

If command-line Git is challenging:

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Add the local repository through the interface
3. Create a new repository on GitHub
4. Publish the local repository to GitHub

This provides a visual interface for the Git operations.

## Option 5: Use Another Git Hosting Service

If GitHub specifically is causing issues:

1. Try [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/)
2. Create a repository on the alternative platform
3. Use similar Git commands but with the alternative platform's URL

## After Sharing

Once you've successfully shared the repository, make sure to:

1. Verify all files are present
2. Check that the directory structure is preserved
3. Make sure the README.md is properly displayed
4. Test that the code can be cloned and run by others

The complete project should include all the source code, configuration files, and documentation for the Multimodal RAG System.
