# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

The local Git repository for this Multimodal RAG System has been initialized and all files have been committed. Follow these steps to push the code to your GitHub account:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "multimodal-rag-system" as the repository name
4. Add the description: "A Python-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for complex websites using visual processing"
5. Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Link the Local Repository to GitHub and Push the Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Set the remote repository URL (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multimodal-rag-system.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all the project files now available on GitHub
3. The repository structure should match the local project structure

## Additional Information

- If you want to collaborate with others, you can add them as collaborators in the repository settings
- You can set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD by creating workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory
- Consider setting up branch protection rules for the main branch

Once pushed to GitHub, you can easily clone the repository to other machines using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multimodal-rag-system.git
```
